nab-al-tools,nabsolutions,1.44.0,refreshXlf,refreshXlf,true,filePath|generatedXlfFilePath,This tool refreshes and synchronizes a XLF language file using the generated XLF file. It takes two parameters: the path to the generated XLF file (named <appname>.g.xlf) and the path to the target XLF file to be refreshed. The tool synchronizes the target XLF file with the latest changes from the generated file by preserving existing translations while adding new translation units from the generated file. It maintains the state of translated units and sorts the file according to the g.xlf structure. This synchronization process ensures that the translation file stays up-to-date with the latest AL code changes without losing existing translation work.
nab-al-tools,nabsolutions,1.44.0,getTextsToTranslate,getTextsToTranslate,true,filePath|limit|offset|sourceLanguageFilePath,"This tool retrieves untranslated texts from a specified XLF file. It returns a JSON object containing: texts (array of translation objects with id, source text, source language, context, maxLength, and comments), totalUntranslatedCount (the total number of untranslated texts in the file), and returnedCount (the number of texts returned in this batch). Each text object includes: id (unique identifier), source text (to be translated), source language, context (describes the context of what is being translated, such as 'Table Customer - Field Name - Property Caption' or 'Page Sales Order - Action Post - Property Caption'), maxLength (character limit if applicable), and contextual comments (explains placeholders like %1, %2, %3 etc.). The context field provides crucial context by identifying the specific AL object (table, page, codeunit, etc.), element (field, action, control), and property (caption, tooltip, etc.) being translated, enabling more accurate and contextually appropriate translations. The totalUntranslatedCount and returnedCount fields help track overall translation progress and pagination. This tool streamlines the translation workflow by identifying which texts need translation and providing comprehensive context for accurate localization."
nab-al-tools,nabsolutions,1.44.0,getTranslatedTextsMap,getTranslatedTextsMap,true,filePath|limit|offset|sourceLanguageFilePath,"This tool retrieves previously translated texts from a specified XLF file as a translation map. It returns a JSON array of translation objects, each containing: sourceText (the original text), targetTexts (an array of one or more translated versions), and sourceLanguage. This unique format groups all translations by their source text, which is particularly useful when the same source text has been translated differently in various contexts or has multiple acceptable translations. For example: {'sourceText': 'Total', 'targetTexts': ['Total', 'Totalt'], 'sourceLanguage': 'en-US'}. This tool helps maintain translation consistency by providing access to existing translation patterns and terminology variations, allowing you to reference previously translated phrases and understand translation choices when working on new content."

Use this to discover how a specific word or phrase is used across the application and to inspect how it has been translated in different contexts."
nab-al-tools,nabsolutions,1.44.0,getTranslatedTextsByState,getTranslatedTextsByState,true,filePath|limit|offset|sourceLanguageFilePath|sourceText|translationStateFilter,"This tool retrieves translated texts from a specified XLF file, filtered by their translation state.

The context field provides crucial context by identifying the specific AL object (table, page, codeunit, etc.), element (field, action, control), and property (caption, tooltip, etc.) being translated, enabling better understanding of existing translations and their business context. This tool streamlines the translation workflow by allowing you to filter translations by their state (e.g., 'needs-review', 'translated', 'final', 'signed-off') and providing comprehensive context for accurate localization."

It takes a generated XLF file path (*.g.xlf), a target language code, and optional parameters to match translations from the base app. The tool creates a new XLF file ready for translation, optionally pre-populated with matching translations from Microsoft's base application.

(2) Automated suggestion generation - validate/adjust outputs against approved terms. (3) Review/QA - detect and highlight deviations from glossary entries. (4) Bulk alignment or terminology normalization workflows. (5) Cross-language comparison by specifying a non-default sourceLanguageCode."
